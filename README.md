# yuki-assistant
 An assistant that is virtually redundant if you're not lazy.
 
 This is really just a pet project of mine to showcase the features of Python and its respective modules.

 This is my first project on Git, so go easy on me if I mess something up.

 Things left to do:

    -Make the the advanced things category.

    -Improve system stats.

    -Make it look pretty. >o<

Pull requests are welcome, I'll probably look at them every day or so.
