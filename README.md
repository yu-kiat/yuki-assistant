# yuki-assistant
 An assistant that is virtually redundant if you're not lazy.
 
 This is really just a pet project of mine to showcase the features of Python and its respective modules.

 Things left to do:
    -Make the the advanced things category.
    -Improve system stats.
    -Make it look pretty. >o<
